# MIP-0056: OODS — an Open Ocean Data Store for Brazilian bathing-water quality, starting with IMA/SC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Accepted — `Tasks: docs/mips/MIP-0056.tasks.md` |
| **Author** | Claude Fable 5.1, from M. Hoffmann's brief of 2026-09-14 ("production-grade data management for water quality … OODS … first step a GHA ingesting IMA/SC … incremental and backfill … STATE or CITY as a parameter, adapters per use case … a common view for all BR data") |
| **Created** | 2026-09-14 |
| **Phase** | 0 — an offline data pipeline and a versioned dataset; nothing waits on the Telegram bot, no Azure resource |
| **Related** | MIP-0001 (the IMA/SC feed and `WaterQuality.scala`'s model — this MIP keeps its columns and adds history), MIP-0031 (INEA/INEMA PDF parsers and curated coordinate tables — the second and third adapters, §5.6), MIP-0016/MIP-0042 (the map's water layer — a consumer, via §5.5's export), `local/src/main/scala/marola/water/CachedWaterQualityClient.scala` (today's only persistence: one snapshot of the last five samples per point, gitignored), `PHILOSOPHY.md` "The Python question" (why the fetchers are Scala and the transform is SQL, §5.2/§9) |
| **Effort** | L — a new sbt module (`oods/`), one new dependency (DuckDB JDBC, in that module only), a CI workflow that commits, a `.gitignore` carve-out, and a one-off ~40 MB data PR. No change to the runtime path until §5.5's opt-in export |
| **Gain** | `user value` — 23 years of per-point history where today there are five samples: "this point is usually IMPRÓPRIA after rain", trends, seasonality (MIP-0001 §9 could only say "the agency's last five"); `infra/dev-loop` — the map's water layer stops depending on a portal that spent a week down in September, because the store is the fallback; `cost/ops` — a public dataset other people can query without running marola |
| **Effort vs Gain** | `do next` — the source is verified live, richer than what the app uses today, free, and the store is what every later state (§5.6) plugs into; the app-facing payoff (§5.5) is one environment variable |
| **Depends on** | Not blocked by any MIP. Reuses MIP-0031's parsers and coordinate tables for the RJ/BA adapters (§5.6, later tasks, not this MIP's first delivery). Needs one human-only configuration change before the workflow can commit: a ruleset bypass for GitHub Actions on `main`, or a PAT secret (§5.4, §11). No Phase 1 gate, no paid resource |
| **Blocked by** | none |
| **Risk** | IMA never published a licence for this data (§4.5, verified: no statement on the portal, not on `dados.sc.gov.br`). Republishing 23 years of it under an open licence in a public repo is a decision this MIP cannot take alone — §11 asks for it. Technically, the risk is a ~40 MB text tree on `main` that grows ~2 MB/year per state |
| **Cost so far** | — |

## 1. Summary

Build `data/oods/`: a git-versioned, everyone-can-read store of Brazilian bathing-water samples,
one adapter per monitoring institute, a common schema, and DuckDB SQL views that union every
state into one table. The first adapter is IMA/SC, fed by the portal's own per-beach CSV history
export (2003 → today, 13 columns, verified live 2026-09-14) rather than the five-sample JSON feed
or the weekly PDF. A GitHub Actions workflow runs it daily, idempotently, and commits only what
changed; a backfill mode fills the history once. Raw files are text and diffable; derived Parquet
is small and rebuilt deterministically. State, city and source are filters on the same planner.

## 2. Motivation

Today marola's only persistence for water quality is `data/water-cache/ima-sc.json`: the last
successful fetch, five samples per point, gitignored, overwritten. When IMA's host served a
self-signed certificate on 2026-09-08 and then nothing on :443, every Florianópolis beach read "no
data" until the PDF backup client landed (`ImaScPdfWaterQualityClient`). The data had not changed;
our copy of it was one file on one machine. Meanwhile the portal holds a history export nobody
in this repo had found: `POST /relatorio/exportarCSV` with `municipioID`, `localID`, `ano` returns
every sample for one beach and year since 2003, with wind, tide, rain, water and air temperature,
the bacteria count (censored values like `<20` included) and the verdict — none of which the JSON
feed carries any more (its `ANALISES` array is gone; today it returns 260 points with coordinates
and a current `CONDICAO` only, verified 2026-09-14).

The brief also names the long-term shape: an Open Ocean Data Store, Brazil first, one adapter per
institute, a common view. MIP-0031 already built two more parsers (INEA/RJ, INEMA/BA) with no
place to accumulate what they parse. This MIP is that place.

## 3. User-visible change

Nothing in the CLI or the map changes in the first tasks — the deliverable is a dataset and a
pipeline. Concretely, after §5.5's one-line opt-in the site build reads water quality from the
store first, so a portal outage no longer blanks the water layer. For a person who is not a marola
user:

```
$ duckdb -c "
  SELECT beach_name, point_name, sampled_on, condition, indicator_value, rain
  FROM read_parquet('data/oods/parquet/*/samples/year=*/*.parquet', hive_partitioning=true)
  WHERE source_id='ima-sc' AND beach_name='Praia do Campeche' AND sampled_on >= '2025-12-01'
  ORDER BY sampled_on DESC LIMIT 3"
┌───────────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────┬─────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Praia do Campeche │ Ponto 35   │ 2025-12-29 │ propria   │ 110             │ Moderada │
│ Praia do Campeche │ Ponto 35   │ 2025-12-16 │ propria   │ 1314            │ Fraca    │
│ Praia do Campeche │ Ponto 35   │ 2025-12-10 │ propria   │ 10              │ Intensa  │
```

Those three rows are real (§Appendix, `campeche-2025.csv`). The common view `br_bathing_water`
(§5.3) returns the same columns for every source once the RJ/BA adapters land.

## 4. Data sources and dependencies reviewed

### 4.1 The pick: IMA/SC's per-beach CSV history export

`POST https://balneabilidade.ima.sc.gov.br/relatorio/exportarCSV` with form fields `municipioID`
(the municipality name, e.g. `Florianópolis`), `localID` (the beach name, e.g. `Praia do Campeche`)
and `ano`. Verified 2026-09-14: HTTP 200 `text/csv; charset=UTF-8`, a UTF-8 BOM, 13 columns:

```
Municipio,Balneario,"Ponto Coleta",Localização,Data,Hora,Vento,Maré,Chuva,"Água (ºC}","Ar (ºC}","E. coli NMP*/100ml",Condição
```

- Enumeration endpoints, all `POST`, empty body, no auth, JSON: `/registro/anosAnalisados` (24
  years, 2003–2026), `/municipio/getMunicipios` (28), `/local/getLocaisByMunicipio?municipioID=`
  (143 beaches statewide; Florianópolis 43). Beach rows carry a beach-level coordinate; the
  point-level coordinates come from `/relatorio/mapa` (260 points, UUID `CODIGO`, stable between
  the 2026-09-10 cache and today).
- Coverage: 2003 → the current year; Campeche 2003 has 31 rows, 2025 has 145 (five points).
  Off-season sampling is monthly and in-season weekly, as the captured Campeche exports show (Appendix). The current year's export is as fresh as the
  HTML history page (both end 2026-08-25 for Campeche; the 2026-09-10 bulletin adds 10 points
  sampled 2026-09-08, none of them Campeche — so no channel is systematically ahead).
- Edge cases verified: a year with no data returns HTTP 200 and one row `…,1999,"Sem registros"`;
  an unknown `localID` returns HTTP 200 with the header only (137 B). Both are "empty", not errors.
- Volume: 143 beaches × 24 years = 3,432 requests; observed sizes 4–24 KB and 0.07–0.23 s each.
  Sequential with a polite 250 ms pause: ~20 minutes once. Rows: ~180 k statewide (estimate from
  Campeche's ~29 samples per point-year × 260 points × 24 years; early years are sparser).
- The CSV has no point id and no coordinates; the join key to the points feed is
  (`Municipio`, `Balneario`, `Ponto Coleta`), verified unique across all 260 live points.
  `PONTO_NOME` alone is not unique (88 distinct names for 260 points, Appendix).
- Not verified: whether the portal rate-limits (no `robots.txt` — it 404s; no documented limit).
  The planner is polite by construction (§5.2) and the workflow is daily, not hourly.

### 4.2 Kept as a second channel: the weekly bulletin PDF

`GET /relatorio/downloadPDF/YYYY-MM-DD`. Verified 2026-09-14: the home page links the last 10
dated bulletins; `2026-08-28` returns a 322 KB PDF, `2026-09-11` (no bulletin that day) 404s. The
Wayback Machine's CDX index lists 192 unique dated bulletins (2023: 19, 2024: 86, 2025: 66, 2026:
21) and the oldest, `2023-03-10`, has the same record layout `ImaScPdfParser` handles today. The
PDF carries the official report number, a verdict per point and the location text *as of that
week* (the CSV renders today's location text for every year). It carries no indicator value. It is
a later task (§5.2, task 7): the CSV alone delivers the history.

### 4.3 Rejected as the primary: the JSON feed `/relatorio/mapa`

It is the point registry (coordinates, IBGE municipality code, current verdict) and nothing else
now — `ANALISES` is gone (verified 2026-09-14: keys are `BALNEARIO, CODIGO, CONDICAO, LATITUDE,
LOCALIZACAO, LONGITUDE, MUNICIPIO, MUNICIPIO_COD_IBGE, PONTO_NOME`). It is fetched every run as
`raw/ima-sc/points.json`, overwritten, so git history is its time series.

### 4.4 Storage format: Parquet + SQL views, not SQLite, not Delta

The brief asked for SQLite, Delta or "Apache". Constraints: the store lives on `main`, must be
readable without marola, and must diff in a PR.

| Option | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Raw text (CSV/JSON/NDJSON as fetched) | **canonical, on Hugging Face, not in git** (revised by task 11) | Immutable per (beach, year) for past years, so one fetch, no churn — but the *tree count*, not the bytes, is what git could not carry: 3,331 CSVs is a pull request no human reviews. It lives in the public dataset `h0ffmann/oods-br-bathing-water` (free, git-versioned, viewer, and DuckDB reads `hf://` directly), synced by the ingest workflow, indexed by the manifest that stays in git |
| Apache Parquet, Hive-partitioned by `source_id`/`year` | **derived, committed** | Columnar, ~1–3 MB for 180 k rows, readable by DuckDB/pandas/polars/Arrow in every language; a past year's partition is rewritten only when its content hash changes (§5.3), so it does not churn either |
| DuckDB SQL (`schema.sql`, `views.sql`) | **the DDL and the common view** | Text, versioned, engine-portable enough; the union view over every source is a query, not a file |
| SQLite | rejected | One binary blob rewritten on every run; unreadable diffs, unmergeable conflicts; the runtime would gain a dependency to read it |
| Delta Lake (delta-rs) / Iceberg | rejected | Their value — ACID, concurrent writers, time travel — is what git already gives a single-writer dataset; a second versioning system, a Rust/Python-only writer, and a heavy JVM reader |
| Git LFS / release assets for raw | rejected | LFS makes the raw layer invisible to `git diff` and to forks, and ties it to one remote's quota; the Hugging Face dataset above is the same trade with a viewer, a public URL per file and no repo quota |

DuckDB is available twice: `python3Packages.duckdb`/`duckdb` 1.5.5 in the flake's locked nixpkgs
(CLI for humans, `just oods-sql`), and `org.duckdb:duckdb_jdbc` on Maven Central (1.3.1.0 latest
per search.maven.org, 2026-09-14) for the build step. The two need not match: only Parquet files
cross the boundary, never a `.duckdb` file.

### 4.5 Licence and terms — the open question

No licence, terms of use, or open-data statement anywhere on `balneabilidade.ima.sc.gov.br`
(home page grepped for licença/termos/dados abertos/Creative Commons: none); `robots.txt` 404s;
`dados.sc.gov.br`'s CKAN search for "balneabilidade" returns 0 datasets (all 2026-09-14). The data
is public administrative information under Lei 12.527/2011 (LAI), which is the basis every
Brazilian civic-data project cites — but that is not a licence grant. §11 asks for the decision.

## 5. Design

### 5.1 Layout on `main`

```
data/oods/
  README.md                         what this is, how to query, provenance, licence
  sources.json                      registry: id, institute, state, country, urls, cadence, licence status
  manifest/ima-sc.json              per raw file: url, sha256, bytes, fetched_at, rows; per partition: content hash
  DATASET-CARD.md                   uploaded as the dataset's README.md by `just oods-raw-push`
  raw/                              GITIGNORED — the dataset's `raw/`, fetched by `just oods-raw-pull`
    ima-sc/points.json              the /relatorio/mapa registry, sorted by CODIGO, one point per line
    ima-sc/csv/<municipio>/<beach>/<year>.csv   exportarCSV bytes verbatim (BOM included) — slugs are ASCII
    ima-sc/bulletins/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl   task 7: rows parsed from each weekly PDF; the PDF itself is not stored
  parquet/ima-sc/
    points.parquet
    samples/year=YYYY/samples.parquet
  latest/ima-sc.json                §5.5: CachedWaterQualityClient's v1 format, the app's opt-in door
oods/sql/schema.sql  build.sql  views.sql   the DDL and the common view — code, not data
```

`sources.json` also carries the raw layer's address, once, at the top level:
`"raw_store": {"kind": "hf-dataset", "repo": "h0ffmann/oods-br-bathing-water", "prefix": "raw/"}` —
the manifest's keys stay `raw/...`, so a reader turns one into
`https://huggingface.co/datasets/<repo>/resolve/main/<key>`.

`.gitignore` gains `!/data/oods/` under the existing `/data/*` rule and then `/data/oods/raw/`; runtime output
(`sightings.jsonl`, `knowledge-index.json`, `water-cache/`) stays ignored. The Docker volume at
`/app/data` is unaffected.

### 5.2 The pipeline — Scala fetchers, SQL transform, one planner

A new sbt module `oods/` (`.dependsOn(local)`, zero Azure, not aggregated into the runtime image)
with `sbt oods/run` behind `just oods-ingest`. Per `PHILOSOPHY.md`, Scala where the parsers and
HTTP helpers already are; Python only where its libraries are the only ones — here they are not
(§9). The transform is SQL because a DDL is the artefact people read.

```scala
package marola.oods

enum Channel derives CanEqual: case Csv, Pdf, Json         // label/fromLabel, never ordinal (.claude/rules/scala.md)
enum Indicator derives CanEqual: case EColi, Enterococci, Unknown
enum Qualifier derives CanEqual: case Exact, Below, Above     // "<20" → (20, Below): censored values are kept, not dropped

final case class SampleRow(                                  // the common model — every adapter produces exactly this
    sourceId: String, pointKey: String, sampledOn: LocalDate, sampledAt: Option[LocalTime],
    condition: BathingCondition, indicator: Indicator, indicatorValue: Option[Int], qualifier: Qualifier,
    rain: Option[String], wind: Option[String], tide: Option[String],
    waterTempC: Option[Double], airTempC: Option[Double], channel: Channel, bulletinDate: Option[LocalDate])

final case class Partition(sourceId: String, channel: Channel, key: String, year: Int, immutable: Boolean)
final case class RawFile(partition: Partition, url: String, bytes: Array[Byte], fetchedAt: Instant)

trait SourceAdapter:
  def source: Source                                          // from sources.json
  def partitions(plan: Plan): List[Partition] < Sync         // IMA: enumerate municipality → beach → year
  def fetch(p: Partition): RawFile < Sync
  def rows(raw: RawFile): Either[ParseError, List[SampleRow]] // pure; unit-tested on captured fixtures
  def points: List[PointRow] < Sync                            // the registry: key, names, coords, geoSource

final case class Plan(sources: Set[String], states: Set[String], cities: Set[String],
                      mode: Mode, fromYear: Int, toYear: Int, dryRun: Boolean, concurrency: Int)
enum Mode derives CanEqual: case Incremental, Backfill
```

Rules the planner (`Ingest.plan`, pure, tested) enforces, the same for every adapter:

- **A partition is the unit of work and of idempotency.** For IMA's CSV channel it is (beach,
  year). A partition is `immutable` when its year is older than the refetch window; an immutable
  partition already in the manifest is skipped without a request. Mutable ones (the current year,
  and the previous year while `today − 45 days` still falls in it — late-December samples post
  in January) are refetched every run and written only when the bytes differ.
- **Incremental** = mutable partitions only (≈ 143–286 requests, ~1 minute). **Backfill** = every
  partition in `[fromYear, toYear]` not in the manifest. Both are the same code path with a
  different filter; a backfill interrupted halfway resumes from the manifest.
- **Politeness:** an explicit `User-Agent: marola-oods (+https://github.com/h0ffmann/marola)`, a
  250 ms pause between requests to one host, `concurrency` ≤ 4, retry on 5xx/timeouts with
  exponential backoff (3 attempts), and a 429/403 aborts the run rather than retrying.
- **`--state SC`, `--city Florianópolis`, `--source ima-sc`** filter `partitions` before fetching;
  a city that no adapter covers is an error, not an empty success.
- **Failure is visible:** the run exits non-zero if any partition failed, after writing the ones
  that succeeded and their manifest entries — never a half-written file (write to a temp path,
  rename).

### 5.3 The DDL and the common view

`oods/sql/schema.sql` is the schema the Parquet files conform to; `build.sql` reads
`raw/**/*.csv` and `points.json` with DuckDB's `read_csv`/`read_json` and writes one partition
per year, sorted by (`point_key`, `sampled_on`, `sampled_at`), so equal input gives equal bytes.
The Scala side runs it through DuckDB JDBC and rewrites a partition only when the content hash
of its sorted rows differs from the manifest's — Parquet writer determinism is then a
nice-to-have, not a requirement (`just oods-build` twice must produce no diff; task 4 tests it).

```sql
CREATE TABLE point (
  source_id     VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- 'ima-sc'
  point_key     VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- source-native stable id: IMA's UUID CODIGO
  country       VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'BR',
  state         VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- 'SC'
  municipality  VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  ibge_code     VARCHAR,                    -- MUNICIPIO_COD_IBGE when the source has it
  beach_name    VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  point_name    VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- 'Ponto 35'
  location_desc VARCHAR,
  lat DOUBLE, lon DOUBLE,
  geo_source    VARCHAR NOT NULL,           -- 'feed' | 'curated' (MIP-0031's tables) | 'none'
  first_seen DATE, last_seen DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (source_id, point_key));

CREATE TABLE sample (
  source_id VARCHAR NOT NULL, point_key VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  sampled_on DATE NOT NULL, sampled_at TIME,
  condition  VARCHAR NOT NULL,              -- 'propria' | 'impropria' | 'unknown' (BathingCondition.label)
  indicator  VARCHAR NOT NULL,              -- 'e_coli' | 'enterococci' | 'unknown'
  indicator_value INTEGER, indicator_qualifier VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'exact',  -- 'exact' | 'below' | 'above'
  rain VARCHAR, wind VARCHAR, tide VARCHAR, water_temp_c DOUBLE, air_temp_c DOUBLE,
  channel VARCHAR NOT NULL,                 -- 'csv' | 'pdf' | 'json'
  bulletin_date DATE, raw_path VARCHAR NOT NULL, ingested_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (source_id, point_key, sampled_on, sampled_at, channel));

-- views.sql: the common view; every source's Parquet, one schema, channel precedence csv > pdf > json
CREATE VIEW br_bathing_water AS
  SELECT s.*, p.state, p.municipality, p.beach_name, p.point_name, p.lat, p.lon
  FROM read_parquet('data/oods/parquet/*/samples/year=*/*.parquet', hive_partitioning=true, union_by_name=true) s
  JOIN read_parquet('data/oods/parquet/*/points.parquet', union_by_name=true) p USING (source_id, point_key)
  QUALIFY row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY source_id, point_key, sampled_on, sampled_at
                             ORDER BY CASE channel WHEN 'csv' THEN 0 WHEN 'pdf' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END) = 1;
CREATE VIEW latest_per_point AS …;          -- what CachedWaterQualityClient's export (§5.5) is built from
CREATE VIEW point_stats AS …;              -- per point: n, share impropria, share impropria given rain ≠ Ausente
```

Two rules the schema encodes on purpose: censored counts (`<20`, `<10`) keep their number and a
qualifier instead of becoming NULL, because "below detection" is information; and the indicator is
a column, because IMA's CSV header says `E. coli` while marola's `WaterSample` field is named
`enterococciPer100ml` — one of them is wrong for this source and the store must not inherit the
guess (§8, §11 follow-up).

### 5.4 The workflow: `oods-ingest.yml`

- `schedule: "0 12 * * *"` (daily; IMA's bulletin days are irregular — the ten dates the index links fall on Tue ×5, Thu ×2, Fri ×2, Wed ×1, Appendix) plus `workflow_dispatch` inputs: `source` (choice, `ima-sc`), `mode`
  (`incremental`/`backfill`), `from_year`, `to_year`, `dry_run`. Runs on
  `${{ vars.CI_RUNNER || 'self-hosted' }}` like `site.yml`, same JDK/sbt/coursier cache steps,
  `concurrency: oods-ingest, cancel-in-progress: false`.
- Steps: ingest → build → `just oods-check` (schema, row counts, no duplicate keys, every sample's
  point exists) → `git diff --quiet data/oods || commit`. A run with nothing new commits nothing.
  Commit message `data(oods): ima-sc <mode> <date> — <n> files, <rows> rows`, with `Cost: $0`
  (no agent) so `just cost-split` stays clean.
- **Committing to `main` needs a decision** (§11): the `main-rule` ruleset requires a pull request
  (verified via the API 2026-09-14; bypass only for the admin role). Either add the GitHub Actions
  integration as a bypass actor (keyless, preferred) or store a fine-grained PAT as
  `OODS_PUSH_TOKEN`. The alternative — a PR per run with auto-merge — collides with
  `require_code_owner_review` and `CODEOWNERS`'s `* @h0ffmann`.
- `ci.yml` is untouched: its `dorny/paths-filter` matches nothing under `data/`, so a data-only
  push runs only the cheap `changes` job. `site.yml`'s 3-hourly build picks the new store up on its
  next run once §5.5 is on.

### 5.5 The app reads the store — one environment variable, no new runtime dependency

`build.sql`'s `latest_per_point` is exported to `data/oods/latest/ima-sc.json` in exactly
`CachedWaterQualityClient`'s on-disk `version: 1` shape (sorted, one point per line). Setting
`MAROLA_WATER_CACHE_DIR=data/oods/latest` in `site.yml` makes the store the fallback the map
already knows how to read: live feed → PDF → **store**, instead of live → PDF → last local fetch.
No DuckDB in `local/`, no image size change, `AppConfig` unchanged.

### 5.6 Rollout: state or city is a filter, an institute is an adapter

| Order | Source | Adapter input | Coordinates | Status of the source check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | IMA/SC (`ima-sc`) | CSV export per beach-year; PDF weekly | feed | verified live, this MIP |
| 2 | INEA/RJ (`inea-rj`) | bulletin PDFs (listing page → newest), `IneaPdfParser` | MIP-0031's curated table | verified in MIP-0031; no history export known — backfill = Wayback + listing archive, not checked |
| 3 | INEMA/BA (`inema-ba`) | `geraBoletim?idcampanha=N` PDFs, `InemaPdfParser` | MIP-0031's curated table | verified in MIP-0031; campaign ids walkable downward for backfill — not checked |
| 4+ | CETESB/SP, IAT/PR, FEPAM/RS, IEMA/ES, CPRH/PE | unknown | unknown | not checked — each needs its own §4 before an adapter; CETESB is rumoured to have a real open-data portal (not verified) |

Each adapter is one PR: a `SourceAdapter`, captured fixtures, a `sources.json` entry. The planner,
manifest, SQL and workflow do not change. `--state RJ` becomes meaningful the day `inea-rj` lands.

## 6. Scoring / safety impact

None. Nothing in `Swimability` or `Recommender` reads the store. §5.5 changes only which file is
the fallback when both live channels fail, and `WaterQuality.fresh`'s 45-day rule still ages the
store's samples out on the agency's own dates.

## 7. Verification plan

Unit tests (all offline, on captured fixtures checked into `oods/src/test/resources/ima-sc/`):

- `ImaScCsvParserSpec` — Campeche 2003/2010/2025/2026 fixtures: BOM stripped, quoted commas in
  `Localização`, `<20` → (20, Below), `Sem registros` → empty, header-only → empty, `PRÓPRIA` and
  `IMPRÓPRIA` → labels, `dd/MM/yyyy` + `HH:mm`; the join to `points.json` by (municipio, beach,
  point) resolves every Campeche row to a UUID and a coordinate.
- `IngestPlanSpec` — which partitions each mode selects on a given date; the January rule; a
  manifest hit skips an immutable partition and never a mutable one; `--city` with no adapter fails.
- `ManifestSpec` — round trip, sorted keys, byte-stable rewrite, atomic replace.
- `IngestRunSpec` — against a stub `Http`: a second run over identical responses writes nothing;
  a 500 retries then records the failure and the run exits non-zero; a 429 aborts.
- `OodsBuildSpec` — `build.sql` over the fixtures: row count, primary-key uniqueness, the channel
  precedence in `br_bathing_water`, and **two builds produce identical file hashes**.
- `LatestExportSpec` — `latest/ima-sc.json` round-trips through `CachedWaterQualityClient.read`.

Live checks, in order: `just oods-ingest --source ima-sc --mode incremental --dry-run` lists ≈143
partitions and fetches nothing; without `--dry-run` it writes them and a second run commits
nothing; `just oods-ingest --mode backfill --from 2003 --to 2025` finishes with zero failures and
`just oods-check` passes; the workflow's `dry_run` dispatch is green; the first scheduled run
produces a commit on `main` with a diff a human can read. Done = all of §5.1 on `main`, the daily
run green for a week, and `just oods-sql "SELECT count(*) FROM br_bathing_water"` ≈ 180 k.

## 8. Risks, limitations, and honest caveats

- **Licence** (§4.5): the store republishes IMA's data; until §11's decision lands, `data/oods/
  README.md` states the source, the LAI basis and that IMA has granted no licence — no CC badge.
- **Names are the join key** for the CSV channel. A beach renamed on the portal splits its history
  into two `localID`s; a point renumbered breaks the (municipio, beach, point) join and the row is
  kept with `point_key = NULL`-free fallback `ima-sc:<slug>` and `geo_source = 'none'` rather than
  dropped — visible in `just oods-check`'s "unmatched" count.
- **`Localização` in the CSV is today's text for every year**; the PDF channel (task 7) is the
  only record of what a point's description was in a given week.
- **E. coli vs enterococci**: the CSV header says E. coli; marola's field name says enterococci; `WaterQuality.scala`'s own doc comment quotes CONAMA 274/2000's enterococci limit, and the recollection that the resolution names both indicators with different limits is from memory (Not checked). Stored as `indicator = 'e_coli'` for
  the CSV channel with the header as the source; `WaterSample`'s naming is a follow-up.
- **Repository growth**: ~40 MB of raw text once, ~2 MB/year/state after; git packs it ~4–5×.
  Above ~200 MB in the tree, move raw to LFS and keep Parquet + manifest in git.
- **A portal outage is not an error in the data**: incremental runs simply commit nothing; the
  workflow's failure notifications are the signal, not "no data" on the map (§5.5).
- **The PDF channel's Wayback backfill** (192 bulletins) is a one-off download of roughly 60 MB (192 × the ~300 KB observed per bulletin — an estimate); the PDFs
  are not stored, only their parsed rows plus sha256 and URL in the manifest.

## 9. Alternatives considered

- **Do nothing** — keep the five-sample cache. Loses 23 years of history the portal already
  serves and leaves the map's water layer one outage away from blank.
- **Python (`oods/` package, DuckDB + pdfplumber)** — the natural ETL toolchain and the more
  familiar one for outside contributors. Lost on `PHILOSOPHY.md`'s own rule: Python stays where
  its libraries are the only ones, and here `Http`, `JsonValue`, `ImaScPdfParser`, `PdfLines`,
  `WaterQualityMatcher.normalise` and DuckDB JDBC all exist on the JVM; a second CSV/PDF parser
  in another language is exactly the duplicated safety-adjacent logic MIP-0042 §4.4 refused. The
  transform being SQL keeps the part contributors read language-neutral. Revisit if adapter
  contributors turn out to be Python-only people.
- **Store the weekly PDFs as the primary** — what the app parses today. 300 KB binary each,
  no indicator value, and 2023-onwards only; the CSV is richer and text.
- **A separate `oods` repository** — cleaner licence story and a smaller marola tree; but the
  adapters reuse marola's parsers and the map is the first consumer. Split later if the store
  outgrows the app (the layout in §5.1 is already self-contained under one directory).
- **SQLite / Delta / LFS** — §4.4.

## 10. Exam-coverage mapping

None directly. `docs/AI-103-MAPPING.md` has no data-ingestion row; the store is what a future
RAG or fine-tune over conditions history (MIP-0025's layer 1, `FUTURE-WORK.md` §9) would ground
on, but that is their mapping, not this MIP's.

## 11. Open questions

- **Licence decision (human):** publish `data/oods/` under CC-BY-4.0 with attribution to IMA/SC,
  ODbL, or no licence statement until IMA answers an e-SIC request? The first data PR (task 6)
  must not merge before this is decided.
- **Write access for the workflow (human):** add the GitHub Actions integration as a bypass actor
  on `main-rule`, or create `OODS_PUSH_TOKEN`? The MIP prefers the bypass (keyless).
- **`data/oods/` vs a top-level `oods-data/`:** the brief says "the `.data` folder"; `data/` is
  also the runtime volume. §5.1 nests under `data/oods/` and carves it out of `.gitignore`.
- **Follow-up MIP:** `WaterSample.enterococciPer100ml` is named for an indicator IMA's own export
  labels `E. coli`; resolving which CONAMA 274 threshold applies (and renaming the field) needs its
  own number.
- **Follow-up MIP:** trend and seasonality features on the map and in replies ("usually improper
  after rain") — the first consumer of `point_stats` beyond the fallback export.
- **Not checked:** IMA's rate limits; whether `getLocaisByMunicipio`'s beach list ever drops a
  beach that still has history (a retired beach's CSV would then never be enumerated — the
  backfill should also iterate the historical municipality list from old `points.json` snapshots
  once they exist).

### Not checked

- CONAMA 274/2000's text: that it sets separate limits for E. coli and enterococci is from memory; only the enterococci figure already quoted in `WaterQuality.scala` was taken from the repo.
- Any rate limit or fair-use policy on IMA's portal; the number of rows statewide (extrapolated from Campeche); whether the CSV's `E. coli` header reflects IMA's laboratory method or a template label.
- Whether DuckDB's Parquet writer is byte-deterministic across runs of the same version (the design does not depend on it, §5.3).
- INEA/INEMA backfill mechanisms and every 4+ source in §5.6.
- The "git scraping" pattern (commit a scrape on every run, git history as the time series) that §4.4 follows — cited from memory, not re-read.
