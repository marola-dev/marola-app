/**
 * The primary source, then a backup when it gives nothing.

 * Written for IMA/SC: its JSON feed went unreachable on 2026-09-08 and Florianópolis lost every
 * verdict, while the same agency's weekly bulletin PDF stayed up the whole time. One agency, two
 * publication channels, and no reason for an outage in one to be a blackout for the user.
 *
 * "Gives nothing" covers both a thrown failure and an empty answer, because from the map's side
 * they are the same thing. Stacked under `CachedWaterQualityClient`, the order is: live feed,
 * backup channel, last good fetch.
