/**
 * Answers "what's the best hour tomorrow to swim nearby?": find beaches near `origin`, fetch each
 * one's forecast, score every hour that falls on *tomorrow in that beach's own local timezone*, and
 * return every (beach, hour) ranked best-first.
 *
 * This is the whole POC pipeline. It's built as a plain function returning `List[BestHour] < Sync`
 * rather than a Foundry-agent-driven flow: there is no LLM call in the critical path — that's a
 * separate step `Main` (in `marola-cli`) composes afterward. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for where
 * the LLM synthesis step and the DSPy-optimized prompt behind it plug in.
 *
 * `distanceRefiner` is dependency-inverted rather than a hardcoded Azure Maps call: `Recommender`
 * lives in `marola-core`, which has zero Azure SDK dependency by design (`FUTURE-WORK.md` §7.3) —
 * `marola-azure`'s `RouteFinder` depends on `marola-core`, not the other way around, so
 * `Recommender` can't reference it directly. `marola-cli` (which depends on both) supplies the
 * actual `RouteFinder.travelDistanceKm` function when an Azure Maps key is configured; `None` (the
 * default) keeps every beach's haversine distance as-is.
